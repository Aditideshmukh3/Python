# t = () - empty () is tuple
# t = (12) or ("string") - value in tuple shows output as int or str
# t = (12,) - ( element + ,) shows output as tuple
# print(t)
# print(type(t))

# t = (12, "python", True, 23.4)
# print(t)
# print(t[0]) - shows the index value of element in tuple
# t[0] = 100 - value replacing is not available in tuple as its immutable
# print(t.index(12)) - shows the index value
# print(t.count(12)) - shows the count of value


# Difference between List & Tuple :
#             List :                                          Tuple:
# 1. bracket []                                     1. bracket ()
# 2. lists are mutable (changes allowed)            2. tuples are immutable (changes not allowed)
# 3. list can be created with single element        3. tuple can only be created with single element if used comma,
# 4. multiple methods are available                 4. only two methods are available (index & count)
